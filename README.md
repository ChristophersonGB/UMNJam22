# UMNJam22
 
UMNJam22 took place during the Fall 22 semester. This was my first ever solo game jam and my first time using Unity2D (not my brightest choice). I was able to learn a lot about Unity2D in a short amount of time but I didn't quite deliver on a great playing experience (or much of a game), but I've at least gotten a Menu with settings and a quit button, so I've at least learned something from last time!


Unity Version : 2021.3.2f1


Game Name: Censor (see theme)

Game Jam Theme: Censor

Awards: Participated

Gameplay instructions: On start, 'Users' will connect to available 'Nodes'. Click on a 'Node' to deactivate it, this will cause the users to find other nodes. If the users or nodes push off screen, please use the beautiful reset button readily available at the bottom of the screen. In options, you can adjust the number of users and nodes, which will update for the next time you play. Enjoy!
