# UMNJam22
 
UMNJam22 took place during the Fall 22 semester. This was my first ever solo game jam and my first time using Unity2D (not my brightest choice). I was able to learn a lot about Unity2D in a short amount of time but I didn't quite deliver on a great playing experience (or much of a game), but I've at least gotten a Menu with settings and a quit button, so I've at least learned something from last time!

Unity Version : 2021.3.2f1
